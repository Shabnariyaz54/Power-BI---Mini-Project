# Power-BI---Mini-Project
Mini Project - Flight Analysis
To find trends, delays, and operational insights, flight analysis in Power BI entails displaying and evaluating airline and airport performance data. To generate interactive dashboards that highlight important parameters like total flights, delay kinds (weather, security, late aircraft, etc.), cancelation reasons, average delay times, and on-time performance, raw flight data is cleaned, processed, and modeled using Power BI. Using filters and slicers, users can examine data by airline, airport, date, or flight status.
